# Software Architecture and System Development (SASD)

This repository contains the laboratory exercises for the Software Architecture and System Development module (CO2123) - a second-year Computer Science course.

## Overview

This module covers fundamental concepts in software architecture, system design, and development practices. The labs provide hands-on experience with modern software development tools and frameworks.

## Lab Structure

### Lab 1 - Introduction to Spring Framework
- **Lab 1A** (`lab1_exa/`): Basic Spring Boot application with MVC controller
- **Lab 1B** (`lab1_exb/`): Date controller with JSP views

### Lab 2 - Model-View-Controller Architecture
- **Lab 2** (`lab2_ex/`): Pet management system demonstrating MVC patterns with models and views

### Lab 3 - Advanced MVC with Data Relationships
- **Lab 3** (`lab3_ex/`): Fitness tracking application with Goals and Exercises, showcasing object relationships and data management

## Technologies Used

- **Java** - Programming language
- **Spring Boot** - Application framework
- **Spring MVC** - Web framework
- **JSP** - JavaServer Pages for view templates
- **Gradle** - Build automation tool
- **Maven** - Dependency management

## Getting Started

Each lab is a standalone Spring Boot application. To run any lab:

1. Navigate to the specific lab directory
2. Run `./gradlew bootRun` (Linux/Mac) or `gradlew.bat bootRun` (Windows)
3. Access the application through your web browser

## Lab Descriptions

### Lab 1A - Basic Spring Application
Simple greeting application demonstrating basic Spring Boot setup and controller functionality.

### Lab 1B - Date Display Application
Application that displays the current date using Spring MVC with JSP templates.

### Lab 2 - Pet Management System
A more comprehensive application showcasing MVC architecture with model classes, controllers, and JSP views for managing pet information.

### Lab 3 - Fitness Tracking Application
An advanced MVC application demonstrating object relationships and data management. Features a fitness tracking system where users can create goals and add exercises to track their fitness activities. Shows how to handle one-to-many relationships between Goals and Exercises.
